        /** ACID Transactions:

        Atomicity - All or nothing. The full transaction must complete. Transaction Record in Memory is held until commited to disk. If any part fails it needs
        To Roll Back to all the original data.
        I.   If any transaction fails, roll back to original data
        II.  This can happen if it fails due to a power failure or system or application crash
        III. When rebooted the LLD sector database will check its instance for its original data.

        Consistency - The database must be brought from one valid state to the next. If any of the transaction sequences fail due to a violation of the rules
        of the database, the whole transaction must fail.
        I.  SectorTransaction class to handle the storing of all sequences of the transaction.
        II. If the commit fails, and the system is still operating, roll back all the transaction data to original states.

        Isolation -All Transactions must execute in the sequence in which they were created in order to have the data changed in the order it was flagged
        To change.
        I. Use a Vector storing the order with a pair of byte vectors for the data type.
        II. Retain this ordering while commiting the transaction to disk.

        Durability - The data in a transaction must be commited to non volatile memory. This will make sure that the transaction will retain independent of a crash
        or power loss even in the middle of the transaction. This is done in three ways:
        I. Flagging of the keychain to set the state of the sector as part of a transaction sequence.
        II. The data checksum is stored in the keychain that defines the state of the sector data to ensure that there was not a crash
        or power loss in the middle of the database write.
        II.Return of the sector keys to a valid state stating that the sectors were written successfully. This will only happen after the sector has been written.

        If there is a power loss before the transaction successfully commits, the original data is backed up in a separate temporary keychain/sector database
        so that on reboot of the node or database, it checks the data for consistency. This will roll back to original data if any of the transaction sequences fail.

        Use a checksum as the transaction original key. If the data fails to read due to invalid state that was never reset, search the database for the original data.
